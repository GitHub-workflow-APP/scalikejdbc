ScalikeJDBC 4.3.0 is now available for Scala 2.12, 2.13, and Scala 3 application development!

![ScalikeJDBC Logo](https://scalikejdbc.org/images/logo.png)

The notable feature enhancement is scalikejdbc-orm module addition! This extension is an O/R mapper built on top of the ScalikeJDBC core library, drawing significant inspiration from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord library. For instance, you can run the following query just with simple CRUDMapper class/object definition:

```scala
Member.joins(Member.email).where(sqls.eq(m.name, "Alice")).apply()
```

Refer to the latest README and document website for more details.
